**California House Price Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project utilizes machine learning to predict the housing prices in California based on various features such as location, number of rooms, and other property characteristics. The goal is to build a regression model that accurately estimates the price of a house based on these inputs.

Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: The dataset used for this project is the well-known California Housing dataset, which contains information like median income, house age, total rooms, and other factors.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection to prepare the dataset for training.
3. Modeling: I experimented with various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict house prices.
4. Evaluation: Models were evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to identify the best model.
5. Results: The Random Forest model performed the best in predicting housing prices with a high level of accuracy.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
